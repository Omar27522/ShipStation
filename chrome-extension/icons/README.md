# Icons Placeholder

This folder should contain the following icon files:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels) 
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

For now, you can use any simple icon images or create them later.
The extension will work without icons, but Chrome will show a default placeholder.

## Quick Icon Creation:
1. Use any image editor or online tool
2. Create simple icons with a clipboard or data extraction theme
3. Save as PNG files with the exact names above
4. Place them in this icons/ folder
